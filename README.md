# PhotoshopTools
Collection of small Photoshop scripts. Developed for and checked with Photoshop 2018 but in theory should work for CS5 and upwards.
If you have an idea for a script, let me know and I'll give it a crack when I have time.

## "Installation" instructions 
To use these scripts:
1. Copy the script into the Scripts folder in the Presets directory of Photoshop. On Windows, this should be `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CC 2018\Presets\Scripts`, or whatever other version of Photoshop you are using. 
2. Restart Photoshop if necessary. 
3. The script should now appear under File > Scripts. It is possible to assign a keyboard shortcut to it.

## Notes on the scripts
- `lock_all_except_active` locks all the layers in the current document except for the selected layer, to prevent you from accidentally painting on the wrong layer. Unfortunately it seems to take a couple of seconds, so probably not very useful. 
- `unlock_all_layers` unlocks all the layers in the current document. Useful if you have lots of nested groups and are trying to reorganise them but some layers are locked.
